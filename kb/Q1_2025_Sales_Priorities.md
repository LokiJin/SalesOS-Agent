## Product Priorities & SPIFFs

### Q1 Product Focus

**1. Security Plus (Software)**
**Target:** Attach to 50% of Enterprise Suite Pro sales  
**SPIFF:** $200 per attach  
**Why:** Healthcare and financial services compliance requirements  
**Objection Handler:** "Security is optional" → "Is compliance optional? Security Plus ensures you pass audits"

**2. Support Package (Services)**
**Target:** Attach to all Gold/Platinum tier customers  
**SPIFF:** $500 per attach  
**Why:** Highest customer satisfaction, 97% retention rate with this package  
**Objection Handler:** "Too expensive" → "Cost is $1,200/month. Your team spends 10+ hours/month on issues. That's $2,500 in time cost. Support Package pays for itself."

**3. Implementation Service (Services)**
**Target:** 90% attach rate for Enterprise Suite Pro  
**SPIFF:** $300 per attach  
**Why:** Faster time-to-value, better onboarding, higher satisfaction  
**Objection Handler:** "We can self-implement" → "Sure, but average self-implementation takes 8-12 weeks vs our 3-4 weeks. Every month delayed is $X in lost value."

**4. Hardware + Software Bundles**
**Target:** 25 hardware deals (Server Rack, Network Router, Workstation Elite)  
**SPIFF:** 5% additional commission on hardware  
**Why:** Higher deal values, natural upsell for on-premise customers  
**Objection Handler:** "We prefer cloud" → "Perfect, cloud for applications, on-premise for sensitive data. Hybrid is best of both worlds."
