**Industry:** Manufacturing  
**Location:** Detroit, Michigan (North America)  
**Size:** 450 employees  
**Customer Tier:** Gold  
**Products:** Enterprise Suite Pro, Analytics Dashboard, Support Package

#### The Challenge

TechManufacturing Co was managing production operations across three facilities using spreadsheets and email. Their process was:
- Production schedules in Excel (updated manually 3x per day)
- Quality reports emailed as PDFs (not searchable)
- Inventory tracked on whiteboards in each facility
- No real-time visibility for management

**Pain Points:**
- Production delays due to outdated information
- Average 4-hour lag between schedule changes and floor implementation
- Quality issues discovered too late (2-3 day detection lag)
- Executives "flying blind" without real-time metrics
- 2 FTE dedicated to compiling daily reports

**What They Tried Before:**
They attempted to build a custom solution with an offshore dev team. After 9 months and $180K spent, they had a partially working system that required constant maintenance.

#### The Solution

Implemented in March 2024:
- **Enterprise Suite Pro** for workflow management
- **Analytics Dashboard** for real-time production metrics
- **Mobile apps** for floor managers to update in real-time

**Implementation Timeline:**

- Week 2: Manager training and pilot (one facility)
- Week 3: Rollout to remaining facilities
- Week 4: Go-live with full team onboarding

#### The Results

**After 6 Months:**

**Cost Savings:**
- Eliminated 2 FTE report compiling positions: **$140K/year saved**
- Reduced quality defects by 64%: **$220K/year in waste reduction**
- Faster schedule changes = 12% production efficiency gain: **$380K/year value**
- Total annual benefit: **$740K**

**Time Savings:**
- Schedule updates now instant vs 4-hour lag
- Quality reports automated vs 2 hours daily manual work
- Executive dashboards real-time vs 24-hour old data

**Business Impact:**

- Customer satisfaction score increased from 7.2 to 8.9
- Won 3 major contracts due to improved reliability

#### Customer Quote
