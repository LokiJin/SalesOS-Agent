❌ "It's a nice company" - Irrelevant  
❌ "I promised it already" - Never promise without approval  
❌ "They're a small business" - Tier bronze exists for this  
❌ "They're shopping around" - Compete on value, not price  
❌ "I want to close faster" - Discounts don't accelerate deals  
❌ "They already have a vendor" - So does everyone - prove ROI

## Bundle Discounts

When selling multiple products together, you can offer bundle discounts **in lieu of** standard discounts (not in addition to):

### Software Bundles
- **Enterprise Suite + Analytics:** 15% off combined price
- **Enterprise Suite + Security Plus:** 12% off combined price
- **All Software Products:** 20% off combined price

### Hardware + Software
- **Any Hardware + Software:** 10% off combined price
- **Hardware + Implementation Service:** 15% off combined price

### Services Attach
- **Software + Support Package:** 10% off Support Package
- **Software + Training (3+ sessions):** 20% off training

**Rules:**
- Bundle discounts replace standard discounts (don't stack)
- All products must be purchased together
- Same contract term for all products

**Example:**
- Enterprise Suite Pro: $3,600/year
- Analytics Dashboard: $2,400/year
- Combined List: $6,000/year
- Bundle Discount (15%): $5,100/year

### Extended Terms Discounts
**Net 45:** No discount  
**Net 60:** No discount (Gold+ only)  
**Net 90:** No discount (Platinum only, requires CFO approval)  

**Note:** Extended terms are a concession, not a discount reason. If they want Net 60 AND a discount, they need to give something in return.

### Accelerated Payment Incentives

**Pre-pay 2 years:** 25% discount  
**Pre-pay 3 years:** 30% discount (VP approval)

## Discount Negotiation Strategies

### Instead of Discounting Price, Add Value

**Option 1: Add More Services**
*"I can't discount the software, but I can include 3 additional training sessions (normally $1,500 value) at no charge."*

**Option 2: Add More Products**
*"Instead of a discount, let me add Cloud Storage Premium (normally $1,200/year) for free for year one."*

**Option 3: Extend Terms**
*"I can't discount, but I can give you Net 60 payment terms instead of Net 30 to help with cash flow."*

**Option 4: Include Future Features**
*"I can't discount now, but I can give you beta access to our new [feature] launching in Q3, which you'd normally pay extra for."*

### Trade Concessions

If they want a discount, ask for something in return:

**Trade 1: Longer Commitment**
*"I can offer 15% off if you commit to 2 years instead of 1 year."*

**Trade 2: Case Study Rights**
*"I can offer 10% off if you agree to be a public reference and case study customer."*

**Trade 3: Larger Deal**
*"I can offer 20% off if you add [Product X] to bring the total to $50K."*

**Trade 4: Faster Close**
*"I can offer 10% off if you can sign by end of this week. After that, the offer expires."*

**Trade 5: Executive Access**
*"I can offer 15% off if your CEO will do a joint webinar with ours about [topic]."*

## Discount Request Process

### Step 1: Customer Asks for Discount
**DO NOT** immediately offer a discount or promise anything.

**Say This:**
*"Let me see what I can do. To help me get you the best possible pricing, can you share:*
- *Your total budget for this project?*
- *Your timeline for making a decision?*
- *Are you evaluating other vendors?"*

### Step 2: Document Business Justification
Fill out the **Discount Request Form** in Salesforce:
- Requested discount percentage
- Business justification
- Competitive situation
- Customer commitment (contract term, deal size, etc.)
- What you're getting in return

### Step 3: Submit for Approval
- <10%: No approval needed
- 10-20%: Submit to RSM via Salesforce
- 20-30%: Submit to VP via Salesforce
- >30%: Email CEO directly with exec summary

### Step 4: Follow Up
- RSM approvals: 24 hours
- VP approvals: 48 hours
- CEO approvals: 5-7 days

**Tip:** Give yourself buffer time. Don't tell customer "I'll have an answer tomorrow" when you need VP approval.

### Step 5: Present to Customer
**If Approved:**
*"Great news - I was able to get approval for [discount amount]. This is contingent on [conditions: 2-year contract, case study, etc.]. Does this work for you?"*

**If Denied:**
*"I presented your case to leadership, but unfortunately we can't go below [approved amount]. However, I can [add value proposition]. Would that work?"*

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake #1: Discounting Too Early
**Problem:** Customer hasn't even seen value yet, and you're cutting price.  
**Fix:** Always demo and establish value before discussing price.

### ❌ Mistake #2: Offering Discount Without Getting Something Back
**Problem:** Discount given freely, nothing gained.  
**Fix:** Trade every concession for a commitment.

### ❌ Mistake #3: Promising Discount You Can't Deliver
**Problem:** Told customer 25% off, RSM only approved 15%.  
**Fix:** Never promise a specific discount without approval first.

### ❌ Mistake #4: Discounting on First Ask
**Problem:** Customer asks for 20% off, you immediately offer 15%.  
**Fix:** Push back first. Understand why they need it. What's their budget?

### ❌ Mistake #5: Not Documenting Approvals
**Problem:** Verbal approval from manager, no paper trail, deal falls apart.  
**Fix:** Always get approvals in writing via Salesforce.

### ❌ Mistake #6: Stacking Discounts
**Problem:** 15% volume discount + 10% multi-year + 5% early payment = 30% total  
**Fix:** Discounts don't stack. Pick the best one or use bundles.

## FAQs

**Q: Can I discount services (consulting, training, implementation)?**  
A: No. Services are already priced at market rate and have thin margins. Don't discount services. Bundle them with software if needed.

**Q: What if competitor is 30% cheaper?**  
A: Compete on total cost of ownership (TCO), not sticker price. Their cheaper price often comes with higher implementation costs, more expensive add-ons, or per-user fees that add up.

**Q: Can I give a discount to close a deal this quarter?**  
A: Not a valid reason alone. If there's strategic value (large deal, strategic account, competitive win), then yes with proper approval.

**Q: Customer says they only have $X budget, which is 25% less than our price.**  
A: Two options: (1) Remove features to fit budget, (2) Show ROI to justify finding more budget. Don't automatically discount to meet their budget.

**Q: What if I already told the customer a discounted price?**  
A: You must honor what you promised or lose credibility. But learn from this - never quote price without approval. Better: "Let me check on that and get back to you."

**Q: Can I give "friends and family" pricing?**  
A: No. Everyone pays. Exceptions only for: current employees, non-profit organizations (separate pricing), or strategic partners (requires CEO approval).
