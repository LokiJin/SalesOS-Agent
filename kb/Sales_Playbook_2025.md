## Qualification Framework: MEDDPICC

Use this framework on every opportunity:

### Metrics
- What metrics will they use to measure success?
- What's their current baseline?
- What improvement do they expect?

**Example:** "They want to reduce report generation time from 4 hours to 30 minutes (87.5% improvement)"

### Economic Buyer
- Who has budget authority?
- What's their approval limit?
- Are they accessible to us?

**Example:** "CFO Sarah Johnson ($100K approval authority, meeting scheduled for March 15)"

### Decision Criteria
- What criteria will they use to evaluate solutions?
- How are criteria weighted?
- Do we score well against criteria?

**Example:** "Top criteria: ease of use (40%), integrations (30%), price (20%), support (10%)"

### Decision Process
- What's the approval process?
- Who needs to sign off?
- What's the timeline?

**Example:** "IT reviews security → VP Finance approves budget → CFO signs contract. 45-day process."

### Paper Process
- Legal review required?
- Procurement involved?
- Security questionnaire needed?

**Example:** "Standard MSA, no legal changes expected. Security review takes 10 business days."

### Identify Pain
- What's the business impact of current state?
- What happens if they don't solve it?
- Is this a must-solve problem or nice-to-have?

**Example:** "Manual reporting causes 5 FTE overhead ($350K/year). Urgent due to audit findings."

### Champion
- Who's our internal advocate?
- Do they have influence?
- Are they actively selling for us?

**Example:** "Director of Analytics Mark Chen, 8 years at company, previously championed CRM implementation successfully"

### Competition
- Who else are they evaluating?
- What's our competitive position?
- Why might they choose us? Them?

**Example:** "Evaluating WorkSuite and BizFlow. We win on ease of use and mobile. They win on price."

## Objection Handling

### "Your price is too high"

**Diagnose:**
- Compared to what? (Get them to name competition)
- What were you expecting to pay?
- What's your total budget for this project?

**Response Option 1 - ROI Focus:**
"I understand price is a concern. Let's look at the ROI. You mentioned the current process costs you $350K/year in FTE time. Our solution at $36K annually pays for itself in just 5 weeks. That's a 10x return in year one."

**Response Option 2 - Value Differentiation:**
"You're right, we're not the cheapest option. That's intentional. We include [unique feature 1], [unique feature 2], and [unique feature 3] that competitors charge extra for. When you factor that in, we're actually 15% less expensive on a total cost of ownership basis."

**Response Option 3 - Flexible Options:**
"Let me show you different packaging options. We can start with just the core platform at $199/month, and add modules as you see value. Many customers start small and expand within 6 months."

### "We're happy with our current solution"

**Diagnose:**
- What solution are you using?
- What do you like about it?
- If you could improve one thing, what would it be?

**Response:**
"That's great to hear! Most of our best customers were initially happy with [competitor]. What they found was that while [competitor] was good at [X], they struggled with [Y and Z]. Is that something you've experienced?"

**Then:** Share a customer story of someone who switched from their current vendor.

### "We need to think about it"

**Diagnose:**
- What specifically do you need to think about?
- What information are you missing?
- Who else needs to be involved in this decision?

**Response:**
"Absolutely, this is an important decision. To help you think through it effectively, can you share what specific concerns or questions you still have? That way I can get you the right information to make a confident decision."

**Then:** Schedule specific follow-up with agenda items to address their concerns.

### "Can you give us a discount?"

**Diagnose:**
- Is price the only barrier to moving forward?
- What discount would make this a no-brainer for you?
- Are you comparing to another vendor's pricing?

**Response Option 1 - Value Add:**
"Rather than discount, let me add value. I can include 2 additional training sessions (normally $1,000) and 20 consulting hours (normally $3,000) at no charge. That's $4,000 in additional value."

**Response Option 2 - Longer Commitment:**
"I can offer 15% off if you commit to a 2-year contract instead of 1-year. That saves you $10,800 over the contract period and locks in pricing before our rate increase in July."

**Response Option 3 - Larger Deal:**
"Let me check on volume pricing. If you added [complementary product] to bring the total to $50K, I can get you into our enterprise pricing tier which would be a 20% discount on everything."

### "We don't have budget right now"

**Diagnose:**
- When does your next budget cycle start?
- Is there any emergency or discretionary budget?
- What would need to happen to find budget?

**Response Option 1 - Budget Planning:**
"I understand. Let's plan ahead. Your new budget starts in [month]? Great, let's get you in the queue now so we can kick off immediately when budget is available. That way you don't lose another [X months] on the old process."

**Response Option 2 - Small Start:**
"What if we started with just [smaller package] for $[low price]/month? That's often below departmental discretionary limits and doesn't require formal budget approval."

**Response Option 3 - Cost Justification:**
"Let's build the business case together. You mentioned this problem costs you $[X]/year. Can I help you document the ROI to justify finding budget?"

### "We need to evaluate other vendors"

**Diagnose:**
- Who else are you looking at?
- What criteria are most important to you?
- What would make us the clear winner?

**Response:**
"Smart approach - you should evaluate options. Most customers compare us with [competitor 1] and [competitor 2]. Here's what customers typically find:

- **vs [Competitor 1]:** We're easier to use and implement faster (3 weeks vs 3 months), but they're 20% cheaper upfront
- **vs [Competitor 2]:** We have better mobile apps and customer support, but they have more enterprise features

Given what you've told me about [their priority], I think [our advantage] is going to be most important to you. How can I help you make this evaluation efficient?"

**Then:** Offer comparison checklist or demo with all vendors present.

## Closing Techniques

### Trial Close
Use throughout the conversation to gauge buying temperature:

- "If we could solve [problem], would this be worth moving forward with?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how excited are you about this solution?"
- "What concerns, if any, do you still have?"

### Assumptive Close
Act as if they've already decided:

- "Let's talk about implementation. When would you like to kick off?"
- "Who from your team should be at the kickoff meeting?"
- "Do you prefer monthly or annual billing?"

### Alternative Close
Give them a choice between two yeses:

- "Would you prefer to start with the Standard or Professional package?"
- "Should we kick off in March or April?"
- "Do you want to include the Support Package now or add it later?"

### Urgency Close
Create time pressure (only if genuine):

- "We have a price increase scheduled for April 1st. If you sign by March 15, I can lock in current pricing."
- "I have implementation slots available for March, but they're filling up. We should reserve yours now."
- "We're ending our Q1 promotion on March 31st. After that, training sessions are extra."

### Summary Close
Recap value to reinforce decision:

"Let me summarize what we've covered:
- You'll save 30 hours/week in report generation (worth $80K/year)
- You'll get better visibility into [metric] to make faster decisions
- Your team will have mobile access to work from anywhere
- Implementation takes just 3 weeks with our turnkey approach
- Total investment is $36K/year, paying for itself in 6 weeks

Does this solve your top priorities and make sense for your business?"
